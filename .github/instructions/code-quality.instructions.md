# Code Quality Registry

Before considering a implementation completed, you must execute the following commands in the terminal:

1.  **Formatting**: Run `pnpm format` to ensure consistent code style.
2.  **Linting**: Run `pnpm lint` to catch potential errors and enforce best practices.
3.  **Type Checking**: Run `pnpm check-types` to verify that there are no TypeScript errors.

If any of these commands fail, you must fix the issues and run them again until they all pass.
